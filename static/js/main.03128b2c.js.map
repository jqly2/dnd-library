To a creature immune to this effect, the weeds and vines feel soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats or beds.</p><p><b>Grove Guardians</b> You can animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to uproot themselves from the ground.

When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can�t willingly move away from the target.

On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.</p><p>A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.</p>\",\"page\":\"phb 214\",\"range\":\"60 feet\",\"components\":\"V, S, M\",\"material\":\"Either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect.\",\"ritual\":\"no\",\"duration\":\"10 days\",\"concentration\":\"no\",\"casting_time\":\"1 hour\",\"level\":\"8th-level\",\"school\":\"Enchantment\",\"class\":\"Druid, Wizard\"},{\"name\":\"Arcane Eye\",\"desc\":\"<p>You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.</p><p>You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet.
